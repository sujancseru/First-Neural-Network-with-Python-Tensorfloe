# Tutorial: A First Neural Network with Python TensorFlow
1. It is important to understand for beginners from where to start Neural Network.
2. In this tutorial, I have demonstrated a simple Neural Network with Python to solve y=3x-7. Throughout this example, atleast someone
can understand how NN works on prediction.
